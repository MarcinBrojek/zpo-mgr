[link to Overleaf (view mode)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bkzncfprpdkh#9766c8)

## Done
- [x] Create more detailed info about constructions during parsing.
- [x] Add possibility to print proves as part of user's code. (in debug mode)
- [x] Add mechanisms that can manipulate executing user's code, for e.x. exit program / subprogram. (in debug mode)
- [x] Optimize parser - make less times of recreating base_gramma and base_transformer.
- [x] Make converter for rules to nice looking latech code.
- [x] Create a feature that allows parse code not only from base - sp(subprogram) - nonterminal.
- [x] Make `LICENSE` file
- [x] Make auto-tests if possible - run_tests.py
