## Debug mode

An important aspect of testing the interpreter is the ability to debug, and that is also the case in this project. Control over the debugger parameters is possible through the [debug_config.yaml](../debugger/debug_config.yaml). To effectively use the implemented debugger, one must understand its behavior. The counting of the depth of individual program elements and the significance of main operations in debug mode will be described below.
