## Introduction

The small-step semantics allows understanding the behavior, the flow of the language, and the result produced by individual syntactic constructs. This semantics is available at the [link to Overleaf (view mode)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bkzncfprpdkh#9766c8) and it pertains to this interpreter. It does not precisely describe its behavior, and therefore, this document will include descriptions of this semantics and discrepancies compared to the actual behavior of the tool.
